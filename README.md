Deciding what to eat can be a pain....
Why not use a simple web application that helps you with the guesswork.
This web application is built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript and its main use is to suggest meal ideas for breakfast, lunch and dinner- taking the guesswork out of deciding what to eat for the day. 
The application is able to suggest ten meals for ten days , making it perfect for helping with meal prep.
