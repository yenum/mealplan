Deciding what to eat can be a pain
Why not use a simple web application that helps you with the guesswork - at least for a week!
This web application is built with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript and its main use is to suggest meal ideas for breakfast, lunch and dinner- taking the guesswork out of deciding what to eat for the day. 
The application is expected to suggest meals for up to ten days , making it perfect for helping with meal prep.
